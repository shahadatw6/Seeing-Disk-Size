Introduction to Measuring the Seeing Disk:

While embarking on the journey to unlock the secrets of the univers, We face this challenge called Seeing disk and Airy disk. Seeing disk is caused by the lumps of air pocket in the atmosphere. Atmosphere turbulence is a consequence of dynamic air current and temperature variation. This introduces distortion in the clarity of the image.

The seeing disk encapsulates the apparent size of the point light source mostly the stars. This directly influences the quality of the data taken for research.

Airy Disk and Seeing Disk: A Brief Exploration of Theory

The Airy disk and the Seeing disk are two fundamental ideas in astronomy that significantly influence how we interpret celestial observations.

Airy Disk:

The core of optical systems in telescopes is the Airy disk, which bears the name of the British astronomer Sir George Biddell Airy, who lived in the 19th century. A distant point source of light, such as a star, will experience diffraction as it travels through a telescope's aperture; this is the bending of light waves around the aperture's edges. A center brilliant spot surrounded by concentric rings of decreasing intensity is produced by this diffraction pattern. The Airy disk is located in the center.

The aperture diameter of the telescope determines the size of the Airy disk. Point source pictures are crisper and more detailed when larger apertures produce smaller Airy disks. The theoretical smallest point source that can occur is represented by the Airy disk.

Seeing disk

The Seeing Disk, on the other hand, is a useful idea that considers actual atmospheric circumstances. Because of temperature changes and air currents, Earth's atmosphere is constantly moving, which causes turbulence that impedes the clarity of astronomical views. The tumultuous atmosphere of a star causes its image to stretch out and produce a blurry area when viewed through a telescope; this is known as the "Seeing disk."

The Seeing disk is not a static, theoretical object like the Airy disk. It fluctuates according on the weather.
